# SAP High Availability Testing

The SAP on Azure Automation framework includes a High Availability (HA) testing component designed to validate that SAP deployments on Azure adhere to established best practices. This component executes a series of automated tests that simulate real-world failure scenarios to ensure the resilience and recovery capabilities of the SAP system.

Leveraging Ansible, the framework orchestrates these failure scenarios and validates the system's automated recovery processes. This document provides guidance on configuring and executing these HA tests.

## Supported Configurations

Azure offers various deployment options for SAP workloads on different operating system distributions. The SAP Testing Automation Framework executes its test scenarios on the SAP system configurations running on Linux distribution. You can find the support matrix on supported Linux distribution version, and high availability configuration pattern in [SAP Testing Automation Framework Supported Platforms and Features](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sap/automation/testing-framework-supportability#supported-sap-system-configurations).

### HANA Topologies

The framework supports the following HANA System Replication topologies for HA testing:

| Topology | Description | Configuration Parameter |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Scale-Up** (default) | Classic two-node HSR with a single primary and secondary node. | `database_scale_out: false` |
| **Scale-Out HSR** | Multi-node HSR with primary and secondary sites containing multiple worker nodes, plus a majority maker node for quorum. | `database_scale_out: true` |


See [DB High Availability Test Cases](./high_availability/DB_HIGH_AVAILABILITY.md) for detailed per-test topology documentation.

## Pre-requisites

Before executing the HA tests, complete the following prerequisite steps.

### 1. Enable Cluster Services on Boot

Ensure that cluster services are configured to start automatically on system boot. Execute the appropriate command for your Linux distribution on one of the cluster nodes:

```bash
# For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
crm cluster enable --all

# For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
pcs cluster enable --all
```

### 2. Configure the Automation Framework

Follow the steps in the [Setup Guide for SAP Testing Automation Framework](./SETUP.MD) to prepare the framework on a designated management server.

### 3. Configure the System for HA Testing

1. Set the `TEST_TYPE` parameter to `SAPFunctionalTests` in `vars.yaml`.
2. Follow the steps in the [System Configuration section of the Setup Guide](./SETUP.MD#2-system-configuration) to provide the details of your SAP system.

### 4. Required Access and Permission (required for Load Balancer)

In the High Availability testing scenario, one of the test cases validates the configuration of the Azure Load Balancer used in the SAP high availability setup. To retrieve the properties of the Azure Load Balancer, the management server VM must have read access to it.

Access can be granted by configuring a managed identity for the management server. For more information on setting up system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities, see [Setup Guide for SAP Testing Automation Framework](./SETUP.MD#4-identity-and-authorization).

1. Depending on the type of managed identity method you want to use, configure managed identity on management server.

   - [Configuring access using user-assigned managed identity](./SETUP.MD#option-1-user-assigned-managed-identity).
   - [Configuring access using system-assigned managed identity](./SETUP.MD#option-2-system-assigned-managed-identity).

1. Grant the managed identity (system- or user-assigned) the built-in **Reader** role on the Azure load balancer used in the SAP high availability cluster configuration.

## Test Execution

Execute the tests using the `sap_automation_qa.sh` script from the `scripts` directory. You can run all tests or specify a subset of test cases.

```bash
# Run all the tests with default parameters
./scripts/sap_automation_qa.sh

# Run specific test cases from HA_DB_HANA group
./scripts/sap_automation_qa.sh --test-groups=HA_DB_HANA --test-cases=[ha-config,primary-node-crash]

# Run specific test cases from HA_SCS group
./scripts/sap_automation_qa.sh --test-groups=HA_SCS --test-cases=[ha-config]

# Run with verbose output
./scripts/sap_automation_qa.sh --test-groups=HA_DB_HANA --test-cases=[primary-node-crash] -vvv
```

### Scale-Out HSR Configuration

For HANA scale-out HSR deployments, set `database_scale_out: true` in the system configuration (extra variables). This enables:

- Scale-out-aware pre-validation (verifies site node lists and majority maker node).
- Site membership-based failover validation instead of exact node identity checks.
- Support for SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut provider alongside SAPHanaSR and SAPHanaSR-angi.

```bash
# Run HA tests for a scale-out HSR deployment
./scripts/sap_automation_qa.sh --test-groups=HA_DB_HANA --extra-vars='database_scale_out=true'
```

## Viewing Test Results

Upon completion, the framework generates a detailed HTML report that summarizes the PASS/FAIL status of each test case and provides detailed execution logs.

1. **Navigate to the workspace directory for your SAP system.**

   Replace `<SYSTEM_CONFIG_NAME>` with the name of your SAP system configuration (e.g., `DEV-WEEU-SAP01-X00`).

   ```bash
   cd WORKSPACES/SYSTEM/<SYSTEM_CONFIG_NAME>/quality_assurance/
   ```

2. **Identify the report file.**

   The report file name follows this format:
   `HA_{SAP_TIER}_{DATABASE_TYPE}_{OS_DISTRO_NAME}_{INVOCATION_ID}.html`

   - `SAP_TIER`: The SAP tier tested (e.g., DB, SCS).
   - `DATABASE_TYPE`: The database type (e.g., HANA).
   - `OS_DISTRO_NAME`: The operating system (e.g., SLES15SP4).
   - `INVOCATION_ID`: A unique identifier for the test run, which is logged at the end of the test execution.

3. **View the report.**

   Open the HTML file in any web browser to review the test results and logs.
