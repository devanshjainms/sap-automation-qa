## Test Case Overview

| Test Case                    | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | More Info                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HA Parameters Validation     | Configuration | The HA parameter validation test validates HA configuration including Corosync settings, Pacemaker resources, SBD device configuration, and SCS system replication setup.  | [ha-config.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/ha-config.yml)                                                        |
| Resource Migration           | Failover      | The Resource Migration test validates planned failover scenarios by controlling resource movement between SCS nodes, ensuring proper role changes and data synchronization. | [ascs-migration.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/ascs-migration.yml)                                        |
| ASCS Node Crash              | Failover      | The ASCS Node Crash test simulates cluster behavior when the ASCS node crashes. It simulates an ASCS node failure by forcefully terminating the process, then verifies automatic failover to the ERS node, monitors system replication status, and confirms service recovery without data loss. | [ascs-node-crash.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/ascs-node-crash.yml) |
| Block Network Communication  | Network       | The Block Network test validates cluster behavior during network partition scenarios by implementing iptables rules to block communication between ASCS and ERS nodes. It verifies split-brain prevention mechanisms, validates proper failover execution when nodes become isolated, and ensures cluster stability and data consistency after network connectivity is restored. | [block-network.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/block-network.yml) |
| Kill Message Server Process  | Process       | The Message Server Process Kill test simulates failure of the message server process on the ASCS node by forcefully terminating it using the kill -9 signal. It verifies proper cluster reaction, automatic failover to the ERS node, and ensures service continuity after the process failure. | [kill-message-server.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/kill-message-server.yml) |
| Kill Enqueue Server Process  | Process       | The Enqueue Server Process Kill test simulates failure of the enqueue server process on the ASCS node by forcefully terminating it using the kill -9 signal. It validates proper cluster behavior, automatic failover execution, and confirms that the enqueue table is properly replicated to preserve the lock state. | [kill-enqueue-server.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/kill-enqueue-server.yml) |
| Kill Enqueue Replication Server Process | Process | The Enqueue Replication Server Process Kill test simulates failure of the replication server process on the ERS node by forcefully terminating it using the kill -9 signal. This test handles both ENSA1 and ENSA2 architectures. It validates the automatic restart of the process and ensures continued replication of the enqueue table. | [kill-enqueue-replication.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/kill-enqueue-replication.yml) |
| Kill sapstartsrv Process for ASCS | Process | The sapstartsrv Process Kill test simulates failure of the SAP Start Service for the ASCS instance by forcefully terminating it using the kill -9 signal. It validates proper cluster reaction, automatic failover to the ERS node, and verifies service restoration after the process failure. | [kill-sapstartsrv.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/kill-sapstartsrv.yml) |
| Manual Restart of ASCS Instance | Control | The Manual Restart test validates cluster behavior when the ASCS instance is manually stopped using sapcontrol. It verifies proper cluster reaction to a controlled instance shutdown, ensures automatic failover to the ERS node, and confirms service continuity throughout the operation. | [manual-restart.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/manual-restart.yml) |
| HAFailoverToNode Test | Control | The HAFailoverToNode test validates SAP's built-in high availability functionality by using the sapcontrol command to trigger a controlled failover. It executes 'HAFailoverToNode' as the SAP administrator user, which initiates a clean migration of the ASCS instance to another node. | [ha-failover-to-node.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/ha-failover-to-node.yml) |
| SAPControl Config Validation | Configuration | The SAPControl Config Validation test runs multiple sapcontrol commands to validate the SCS configuration. It executes commands like HAGetFailoverConfig, HACheckFailoverConfig, and HACheckConfig, capturing their outputs and statuses to ensure proper configuration and functionality. | [sapcontrol-config.yml](../src/roles/ha_scs/tasks/sapcontrol-config.yml) |
