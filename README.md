## 🔍 Overview

The SAP Testing Automation Framework is an open-source orchestration tool for validating SAP deployments on Microsoft Azure. This framework systematically evaluates system configuration, performance, and resilience across diverse operational scenarios, providing organizations with actionable insights and quantifiable results. Through thorough testing, the framework helps SAP admins ensure their environments meet performance benchmarks and availability requirements. By simulating real conditions in controlled environments, admins can identify potential issues before they affect production systems.

The framework incorporates advanced monitoring capabilities, detailed analytical reporting, and fully automated evaluation processes, delivering significant operational efficiencies while enhancing the overall reliability of SAP landscapes on Azure.

### 📊 Key Features

- **High Availability Testing** - Comprehensive validation of failover mechanisms for both SAP HANA database clusters and Central Services components, ensuring business continuity under adverse conditions. Currently, the framework offers test scenarios focusing on high availability functional testing and configuration checks. Under the high availability category, we address critical components including:

  - **SAP HANA Database HA Configurations:** Validate SAP HANA database configurations, ensuring resilience, rapid failover, and optimal performance even in adverse conditions.
  
  - **SAP Central Services (SCS/ERS) HA Setups:** Test and verify the configuration integrity and robustness of SAP Central Services, including load balancing, failover mechanisms, and component interoperability.

- **Configuration Validation** - Systematic assessment of SAP system configurations against established best practices and Microsoft-recommended architecture standards to ensure optimal deployment.

- **Detailed Reporting** - Generation of comprehensive test result documentation with analytical summaries and specific remediation guidance for identified issues.

### 🏆 Purpose

Testing is essential for ensuring business continuity in mission-critical SAP environments. This framework systematically addresses the following critical business needs:

- **Risk Mitigation**:
The framework provides systematic testing of failure scenarios, helping organizations identify and address potential issues before they impact production systems. It simulates various failure modes, including node failures, network interruptions, and storage issues, ensuring that recovery mechanisms function as designed.

- **Compliance**:
Organizations must often demonstrate that their SAP systems meet specific availability requirements. This framework provides documented evidence of HA testing, including detailed logs and reports that can be used for audit purposes. It helps ensure that HA implementations align with organizational standards and regulatory requirements.

- **Quality Assurance**:
Through automated and consistent testing procedures, the framework helps maintain high quality standards across SAP infrastructure components. It validates that all HA mechanisms, including clustering software, storage replication, and application-level failover, work together seamlessly.

- **Automation**:
Manual testing of HA configurations is time-consuming and prone to human error. This framework automates the entire testing process, from setup to execution and reporting, significantly reducing the operational overhead of HA testing while improving accuracy and consistency.

## 🚦 Get Started

There are two primary ways to get started with the SAP Testing Automated Framework. Choose the path that best fits your current environment and objectives:

### Option 1: [Integration with SAP Deployment Automation Framework (SDAF)](./docs/SDAF_INTEGRATION.md)

If you already have [SDAF](https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation) environment set up, integrating the SAP Testing Automation Framework is a natural extension that allows you to leverage existing deployment pipelines and configurations.

### Option 2: [Getting Started with High Availability Testing (Standalone)](./docs/HIGH_AVAILABILITY.md)

For users focused solely on validating SAP functionality and configurations, the standalone approach offers a streamlined process to test critical SAP components without the complexity of full deployment integration.
